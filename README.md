# Vectorized GTA V Map (Ultraviolet Blueprint version)

## Tools used
- Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop
- Inkscape (vectorizing pngs)

## About Project
This was a personal project to vectorize the GTA V map. The UV map was only included as in the Special and Collector's Editions of Grand Theft Auto V; there were no digital images of it available online, and we were limited to photos of it uploaded by fellow users that had uneven lighting, creases, or other imperfections. I wanted an image I could laser etch and possibly use as a wallpaper, and decided to make my own version of the UV map since no one had made one before.

This repository contains the following files-
- __gtavmap_uv.ai__: Raw Illustrator file that can be edited
- __export/Comparison (laseretch, UV, original).png__: Comparison of map variants
- __export/GTAV laseretch BW.png__: png used for laser etching
- __export/GTAV-RGB.png__: high-resolution color png of UV map
- __export/GTAV-RGB-small.png__: low-resolution color png of UV map
- __export/GTAV-RGB-vector.ai__: Flattened Illustrator file.
- __Fonts (Dir)__: Fonts used to develop the visualization
- __Links (Dir)__ Files called on by the gravmap_uv.ai
